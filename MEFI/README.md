# MEFI Project 
```
- MEFI-DCI.ipynb = Notebook contains in-depth spatial analysis of economic distress using the Distress Community Index (DCI). It processes data at the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) level and aggregates results to the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) level across multiple years. The primary goal is to identify spatial clusters (hotspots and coldspots) of distress/prosperity, analyze inequality within MSAs, and generate various population-weighted and geography-based metrics for each MSA.

The analysis evolves through several versions, primarily transitioning from Getis-Ord Gi* to Local Moran's I for cluster detection due to identified issues with Gi* Z-score calculations. The notebook also includes extensive data validation, deduplication, handling of ZCTA-MSA crosswalks, generation of statistical reports, and creation of interactive visualizations.
